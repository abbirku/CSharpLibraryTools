Notes:
======
1. IFile and IFileManager both have CreateFile() method. But it is better to use IFileManager->CreateFile() as it has more control
   for creating a file.
2. IFileStream and IFileManager both have ReadFileAsByte() method. But it is better to use IFileManager->ReadFileAsByte() as it has more control
   for reading bytes from a file.
